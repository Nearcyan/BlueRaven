## üë• Contributions

Contributions are desired and welcome - **please test on all browsers beforehand!**

Note from the AI's assitant: 100% of this codebase was written by AI and I have not reviewed almost any of it.

genAI can generally one-shot most features if you feed it the proper HTML - just show it the popup window and the config.js and then make sure you make edits for all browsers.
